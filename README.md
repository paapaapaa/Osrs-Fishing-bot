# ü¶ê Osrs-Fishing-bot ü¶ê (Old)

An Old Fishing color bot for Old Shool Runescape I made. The Idea was to just see if I could do it and how could it be done. The bot searches for specific images on the screen and clicks them when necessary.
This bot was very crude, although it did work. However it was banned in less than a day. Probably something to do with mouse moving in straight lines and teleporting around screen. Maybe teleporting would have been fine on mobile.

It could probably be made better but refining a color bot seems wasted effort. Some other way to input game_state to the bot would make it way faster. This implementation also requires the game to be on your screen at all times, which is not ideal.

I just added the bot here for safekeeping.
